I have posted a Code of hexaConduct. I personally believe this is an important step in creating a community. While we are a community of shitposters, we should hold ourselves to standards and conduct ourselves with the kindness and productivity we wish to see in the world.



## Why does a cult need a CohC?

CoCs and CohCs offer guidance for interacting with other members and the outside world. This will help us moving forward with events, stickers, badges, posts, etc. We are about kindness and understanding. These help us be productive with one another. 

## Okay, what do I need to know?

Here are the Basics:

* We are staunchly anti-racism, anti-homophobia, and anti-sexism.
* We punch up, not down.
* We believe in discussion, not argument.
* We hold each other accountable for our actions.
* We are about kindness.

Here are the key tenets of the hexaCult:

* Hate is not permitted, and kindness will always win.
* Discussion, not argument, is the only way to understanding.
* You will always be accountable. Accountability keeps us honest.
* Be the change you want to see in the world.
* Be productive, self care counts as productivity.
* Never argue in bad faith. Genuine curiousity is beautiful and encouraged, however, bad faith arguments and questions are discouraged and unproductive.

## What about contributing?

That's easy! Just hold up the CohC and the key tenets of the HexaCult.

## I DON'T LIKE THIS!!!!

I don't care. This is an at-will cult. Feel free to DM me ([@comradeeevee](https://twitter.com/comradeeevee)) with any questions, concerns, praise, etc. 



# PRAISE HEXAGON!
