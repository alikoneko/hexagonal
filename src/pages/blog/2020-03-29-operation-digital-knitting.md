Knitting is usually thought of as a hobby where one can start a project, stop part way, and then finish it later. Digital knitting is this, but with digital art and programming projects, basically, if you can post it online, its digital knitting.

## So what does that have to do with Hexagons?

A core tenet of the HexaCult is that self care is productive. Right now, RIGHT THIS SECOND, we need self care. We need projects. We need Digital Knitting. We need something to do to keep sane, and not focus on the chaos that is consuming everything. **Self care is productive.** 

I have tweeted it a couple times already, but the world is burning, and we need to be able to have fun and stay sane.

## So what is "Operation: Digital Knitting"?

Well, its a few things.

1. I am going to try to collect and collate all the virtual conference information I can, and post it here for each month. I WILL NEED HELP WITH THIS TIL I AUTOMATE IT.
2. I will be making a small bot that will tweet out a weekly challenge (randomized stack, learn you a thing), a HTB challenge, or just a small programming project. I want to keep this open to people who are new as well, and will have to figure out a rating system. Prizes will either be a Humble Bundle Programming/Tech book bundle, stickers from my stash, or like $10 to HTB.
3. Create a spot for "best in show", "best new comer", "quickest solve" etc. for the hackathon bot (also find friends that would like to help me judge these apps).

## How can I help?

You can help by participating, donating stickers or prizes to the weekly hackathon (I'm capping the prizes at like $10).  You can help by judging these projects. You can help by doing stuff that makes you happy and helps with quarantine crazies.
