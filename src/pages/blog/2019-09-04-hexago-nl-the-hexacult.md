# Praise Hexagon!

I have finally finished the site where I will collect the lore of the HexaCult, as well as any derivative works about the HexaCult.

## How did this start?

It started with a shitpost, as all good things in life do.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PLEASE BE SEATED IN THE PRODUCTIVITY HEXAGON.<br>THE PRODUCTIVITY HEXAGON CYCLE WILL NOW COMMENCE.<br>PLEASE ONLY BE PRODUCTIVE IN THE PRODUCTIVITY HEXAGON.<br>THE PRODUCTIVITY HEXAGON IS YOUR FRIEND<br>THE PRODUCTIVITY HEXAGON LOVES YOU <a href="https://t.co/TbuuCsT90L">pic.twitter.com/TbuuCsT90L</a></p>&mdash; â˜­eevee_maybe_derby_hexagon.rb (@ComradeEevee) <a href="https://twitter.com/ComradeEevee/status/1167053541292331008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2019</a></blockquote>
